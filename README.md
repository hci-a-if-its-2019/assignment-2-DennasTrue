# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.

### 2. Version Differences
#### Original
The Original website novels tab have novels sorted with default sorting which was enough if the website only have 20 or less novel then it will be enough. But the website contains at least  300 novels and there is no other option than alphabet sorting,date,and Favorite novels.It will be hard to found a novel with certain genre when you browsing throught the nover list or impossible,since there is too much sub genre.The sub genre also hinder the user to search for certain novel ,since it have redirection link to filtered sorting with the novel only with that genre.
#### Solution 1
In this version,I propose to add new function beside novel sorting.The function is filter,it's function is to filter certain genre.One Clicked it will expanded and show us list of genre with the dots on the left on the genre.You can click multiple dots to only show user novel with have certain  genres both of sub and main genre. Not only that you can click the dots twice and it will become X and that genre won't be shown and minimize the result.
#### Solution 2
This time,I propose to hide sub genre ,and only show it when you open the novel mainpage.The reason for this was because sometimes it was accessed by certain unexperienced user and they are confused by multiple genres of novel haves .They come to the website because they already known the name of novels or read novel based on the ranking of favorite novel which is set as default for original version. By hiding it ,The won't question the novel genres and pick based on popular pick or novel with highest Favorite.
#### Solution 3
In the last Version ,I planned to add new search function that filter the genres like the Solution one,but easier to understand for inexperienced user.This version mainly  for mobile user since it's easier for phone  user to filter by words they type and they want the website to be easy to understand. The solution 3 can minimize the result but not that much compared to solution 1.


### 3. Selected Sketch

I choose Solution 3 because It's the the simplest and can be easily accessed anywhere which is crucial for entertaiment website. Solution 3 also easiest to understand and easy to use for new user who accessed the website.

### 4. Design Rationale
For me A bad design is a design where the user itself have hard time to use certain website and a Website should be friendly toward both phone and website user.Since A good website should be easy to understand and simple to use so user would continue to use that website.

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
Operating System : Windows,IoS,linux,Android.
Physical Input : Keyboard,Touch screen
Screen Size : 15.6 inch for computer,5-6.5 inch for smartphone
Screen Resolution : Min (1366 x 768) or higher with screen ration of 16:9,
Screen Color Space : RGB
### 2. Users
 The user is also expected to be familiar with modern web browser such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. The user is also expected to be 18 years old ,the age where you have either phone or pc even both. The user also expected to understand what is genre for using the website to the fullest.

## Part C: Prototypes
